/*
 * Design:
 * 
 * Variables:
 * Coin coin - Coin object, this objet is used from subfolder named Coin, which is a package
 * Simulation simulation - Simulation object, this object is used from subfolder named Simulation, which is a package
 * 
 * 
 * Input: None, because I use library that randomly generates heads or tails
 * 
 * Output: 
 * The program will display the number of times the coin landed on heads and the number of times it landed on tails.
 * 
 * Processing:
 * The program will create a Coin object and a Simulation object. The program will then call the tossForSimulation method
